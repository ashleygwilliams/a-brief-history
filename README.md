# Talk Abstract

Modularity is a term so common in today’s software industry, that it’s easy to uncritically accept it as a fundamental software development principle. but what does “modularity” *actually* mean? where does this idea come from? where is it going? this talk will walk us through the technical etymology of “modularity”, stepping through the intellectual breakthroughs alongside the fast spread misconceptions. we’ll conclude by exploring the implications of modularity’s ill-examined history on both its current use today, and where it’s heading in the future.

# Author bio

Ashley is the developer community and content manager at npm, Inc. if you don't understand how npm works, it's her problem ;)
 
 Formerly a NYC Teaching Fellow, Ashley learned the ropes teaching middle school science in Harlem, NYC. Since then, she has spent the vast majority of the past few years teaching web development to beginners, most notably running the NYC Web Development Fellowship in its flagship year. When not headlong in a discussion about pedagogy, she is probably getting seriously fired up about philosophy, language, systems, and/or jokes.
